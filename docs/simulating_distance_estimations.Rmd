Maximally detectable Aitchison distance between samples from count data may be bounded by  
1) number of features - because big distances require some features to be proportionally very low, making them meaninglessly close to zero for sampling purposes  

2) sequencing depth - more likely to have very low values be zero and thus indistinguishable from other very low values  

This is likely not unique to Aitchison distance but rather due to the nature of sampling.  

q: can we determine maximum distance for a given depth and number of features?

sampled <- sapply(X = seq(1/2,100, by = 1/2), 
       FUN = function(x){perturb_by_relab(rep(1, 100), by = x)}) %>% 
  cbind(b1 = rep(1, 100), .) %>% 
  
  #This one skews the curve!!
  #getTableMeans(., CLR_transformed = F) %>%
